Building a user interface that meets the needs of a diverse population can be incredibly difficult. Research the best practices for developing a universally usable interface, as well as some of the federal legislation that applies (i.e., section 255).

<ol>

 <li>Assess at least five (5) best practices for developing a universally usable interface.</li>

 <li>Evaluate how section 255 affects developing user interfaces and assess this compliancy standard’s impact on users.</li>

 <li>Give three (3) examples of available tools for verifying that your interfaces meet universal design guidelines and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</li>

 <li>Examine the practicality of building multiple interface options for diverse populations, rather than building one (1) interface that meets the needs of the majority of end users.</li>

 <li>Use at least three (3) quality resources in this assignment. Note: Wikipedia and similar Websites do not qualify as quality resources.</li>

</ol>
